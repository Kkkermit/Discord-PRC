# Discord-RPC

// **How to use the Discord-rpc** //

// To begin create a new application in the Discord Dev portal. You don't have to do anything else there apart from changing the name of the application. 

// Create a new folder on your desktop. 

// Type in cmd at the top of the folder path. When in the cmd, type ``npm init`` and then click through everything it asks you. when presented with the word ``yes`` at      the end of clicking through, type ``yes``. After that type ``code.`` in the cmd to open up Visual Studio Code. You will need Visual Studio code installed to do this.    If you don't have it installed, install it.

// When in Visual Studio code, copy and paste the file ``index.js`` from here into folder. You will then need to enter in your application ID which can be found in the      Discord Dev portal on the application. copy and paste that into the first line in the ``index.js`` where it asks for your ID.

// Follow the rest of the steps on the ``index.js`` file and when done, run the code by typing in ``node.`` in the terminal. it should then display the RPC on your          profile.
