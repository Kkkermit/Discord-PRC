# 🎮 Discord-RPC Guide 🚀

Welcome to the **Discord-RPC** guide! This document will walk you through the process of setting up your own Discord Rich Presence. Let's get started! 🎉

## Step 1: Create a New Application 📝

Start by creating a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You can name the application anything you like however, what ever you name it, this will become the name of the RPC. Remember to note down the application ID, you'll need it later!

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace 🗂️

Next, create a new folder on your desktop. This will be your workspace for setting up Discord-RPC.

## Step 3: Initialize Your Project 🚀

Open the Command Prompt (cmd) in your new folder (you can do this by typing `cmd` in the folder path at the top). Once the Command Prompt is open, type `npm init` and follow the prompts. When asked to confirm, type `yes`. Alternatively you can also do this in your editor terminal as well.

## Step 4: Open Your Project in VS Code 📚

After initializing your project, type `code .` in the Command Prompt to open your project in Visual Studio Code. If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Step 5: Set Up Your `index.js` File 📄

In Visual Studio Code, copy and paste the `index.js` file from this repository into your project folder. Replace the placeholder application ID with your actual application ID from the Discord Developer Portal. Fill in the rest of the sections on the `RPC.setActivity` as well.

## Step 6: Run Your Code 🏃‍♂️

Finally, run your code by typing `node .` in the terminal. If everything is set up correctly, your Discord profile should now display your custom Rich Presence!

That's it! You've successfully set up your own Discord-RPC. Enjoy! 🎉
